*I download MP3 of tracks/sets/albums from various websites with tags and artwork. Files over 50 MB are split into parts due to bot-sent file size limit. Everything is 128 kbps:*
*SoundCloud*: tracks/playlists
*Bandcamp*: tracks/albums, non-`bandcamp.com` links work only with `/dl` command
*YouTube*: videos/playlists/no live streams pls
*Mixcloud*: unstable and slow

- Send a message with links to chat and I will instantly download them in PM or ask you in groups. [Privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) is _disabled_ so I parse all group messages for links. Forwarded messages work too. Example:
`Check it out! https://m.soundcloud.com/richarddjames/umil-25-01 and also https://shitmat.bandcamp.com/track/amen-babylon-2016-mix`

- Use `/dl <link(-s)>` command to download instantly in groups.
