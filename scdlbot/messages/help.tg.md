*I download MP3 of tracks/sets/albums from various websites with tags and artwork. Files over 50 MB are split into parts due to bot-sent file size limit.*

*Everything is 128 kbps:*
*SoundCloud*: tracks/playlists
*Bandcamp*: tracks/albums, non-`bandcamp.com` links work only with `/dl` command
*YouTube*: videos/playlists/no live streams pls
*Mixcloud*: unstable and slow
_More to come.._

*Just send a text with links, even mobile, like this (forwarded messages work too) and I will ask you whether to download them or not:*
`Check it out! https://m.soundcloud.com/richarddjames/umil-25-01 and also https://shitmat.bandcamp.com/track/amen-babylon-2016-mix`

[Privacy mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots#privacy-mode) is _disabled_ so I will grab links from all messages in groups too.

*Or use /dl or /dl@scdlbot command to download immediately:*
`/dl hey, https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug0y1ZhdHT0 is neat! luvin' it`

*Inline mode might be slow:*
`@scdlbot https://youtube.com/watch?v=N9XKLqGqwLA`
